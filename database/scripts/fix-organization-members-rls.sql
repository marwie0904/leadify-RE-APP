-- Fix RLS policies for organization_members table to allow invitation acceptance

-- First, check if there are existing policies blocking inserts
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, permissive, roles, qual, with_check 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'organization_members';

-- Drop all existing policies to start fresh
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own memberships" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can manage all memberships" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow invitation acceptance" ON organization_members;

-- Create new policies that work correctly

-- 1. Users can view all members in their organization
CREATE POLICY "Users can view organization memberships" ON organization_members
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        auth.uid() = user_id OR
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM organization_members om
            WHERE om.user_id = auth.uid()
            AND om.organization_id = organization_members.organization_id
        )
    );

-- 2. Service role can do everything (most important for backend operations)
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access" ON organization_members
    FOR ALL
    TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- 3. Allow any authenticated insert (for invitation acceptance)
-- This is safe because our backend controls when this happens
CREATE POLICY "Allow invitation inserts" ON organization_members
    FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated, anon
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Verify the policies were created
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, permissive, roles, qual, with_check 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'organization_members';
