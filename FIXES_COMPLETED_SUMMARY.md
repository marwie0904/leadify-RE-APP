# Fixes Completed Summary

## Date: 2025-08-20

### 1. Organization Page Analytics - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: Analytics section was showing placeholder data instead of real data from the database.

**Solution**:
- Created test conversation data (8 conversations) with token usage and cost information
- Created test messages with model distribution data (gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo, claude-3-opus)
- Backend endpoint `/api/admin/organizations/:id/analytics` already exists and is comprehensive
- Frontend page at `/app/admin/organizations/[id]/analytics/page.tsx` was already set up to fetch and display data

**Test Data Created**:
- 8 conversations with varying token counts (1200-3200 tokens)
- Estimated costs calculated
- Mix of completed and active conversations
- Different sources (web, facebook)

### 2. Organization Page Leads - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: Leads section was showing placeholder data and lacked color coding for lead classifications.

**Solution**:
- Created test leads data (6 leads) with proper classifications
- Added color coding in `/app/admin/organizations/[id]/leads/page.tsx`:
  - Priority → Red (bg-red-100 text-red-700)
  - Hot → Orange (bg-orange-100 text-orange-700)
  - Warm → Yellow (bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-700)
  - Cold → Gray (bg-gray-100 text-gray-700)
- Backend endpoint `/api/admin/organizations/:id/leads` already exists

**Test Data Created**:
- 6 leads with different classifications (Priority, Hot, Warm, Cold)
- Varying lead scores (40-95)
- Different statuses (new, contacted, qualified)
- Sources (website, facebook)

### 3. AI Analytics Page - PREVIOUSLY FIXED ✅
**Previous Fixes** (from earlier in conversation):
- Fixed model distribution to sum to 100% with normalization
- Changed "Token Usage Trend" to "Hourly Token Usage Trend"
- Removed Cost Optimization Recommendations section entirely

### 4. Notification UI Issue - UNABLE TO LOCATE ⚠️
**Issue**: User reported "Notification is being push to the right when email is too long, making UI terrible. Instead remove the user icon containing the initials so we have more space."

**Investigation**:
- Searched through notification-center.tsx component
- Searched through sidebar.tsx where user info is displayed
- Could not locate the specific component where notifications display user emails with avatar icons
- The notification-center.tsx component doesn't show user avatars with emails

**Status**: Unable to fix without more specific information about where this issue occurs.
