# Custom BANT Questions Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a custom BANT questions feature that allows users to define their own qualification questions for each BANT category (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) instead of using pre-defined questions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema
Created a new table `agent_bant_questions` with the following structure:
- `id`: UUID primary key
- `agent_id`: Foreign key to agents table
- `category`: ENUM ('budget', 'authority', 'need', 'timeline')
- `question_text`: The actual question text
- `question_order`: Order within category
- `is_active`: Boolean for enabling/disabling questions
- `placeholder_text`: Helper text for users
- `help_text`: Additional context for the question
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

**Migration file**: `/BACKEND/migrations/add-custom-bant-questions.sql`

### 2. Backend API Endpoints
Added three new endpoints in `/BACKEND/server.js`:

#### GET `/api/agents/:id/bant-questions`
- Fetches custom questions for a specific agent
- Returns default questions if no custom ones exist
- Includes authorization checks

#### POST `/api/agents/:id/bant-questions`
- Saves/updates custom questions for an agent
- Replaces all existing questions with new ones
- Validates question structure

#### GET `/api/bant-questions/defaults`
- Returns default BANT questions as templates
- Used for initializing new agents

### 3. Conversation Engine Integration
Modified the conversation flow in `/BACKEND/server.js` (lines 6233-6309):
- Fetches custom questions when BANT qualification starts
- Falls back to default questions if custom ones aren't available
- Dynamically generates prompts using custom questions
- Maintains the same BANT flow logic but with personalized questions

### 4. Frontend Components

#### New Component: `CustomBANTQuestions`
Location: `/FRONTEND/financial-dashboard-2/components/agents/custom-bant-questions.tsx`

Features:
- Tabbed interface for each BANT category
- Add/edit/delete questions functionality
- Drag-and-drop reordering within categories
- Placeholder and help text support
- Save/reset to defaults functionality

#### Updated: Agent Creation Wizard
Location: `/FRONTEND/financial-dashboard-2/components/onboarding/agent-creation-wizard.tsx`

Changes:
- Added new step "bant-questions" after "agent-info"
- Integrated CustomBANTQuestions component
- Saves questions during agent creation

#### Updated: Agent Management Page
Location: `/FRONTEND/financial-dashboard-2/components/agents/agent-management-page.tsx`

Changes:
- Added CustomBANTQuestions section
- Loads existing questions on mount
- Allows editing after agent creation

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute the following SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS agent_bant_questions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    agent_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES agents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    category TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (category IN ('budget', 'authority', 'need', 'timeline')),
    question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    question_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    placeholder_text TEXT,
    help_text TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_agent_bant_questions_agent_id ON agent_bant_questions(agent_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_agent_bant_questions_category ON agent_bant_questions(category);
```

### 2. Insert Default Questions
After creating the table, run: `node run-bant-questions-migration-simple.js`

### 3. Test the Feature
Use the provided test script: `node test-custom-bant-questions.js`

## User Flow

### During Onboarding
1. Create organization → Name agent and language
2. **NEW: Custom BANT Questions** → Define questions for each category
3. Custom BANT Configurations → Set weights and thresholds
4. Upload Files → Create Agent

### In Agent Settings
1. Navigate to Agents page
2. Select an agent
3. Find "Custom BANT Questions" section
4. Edit questions as needed
5. Save changes

### In Conversations
- The AI agent automatically uses custom questions during BANT qualification
- Questions are asked in the defined order within each category
- Maintains the same BANT flow (Budget → Authority → Need → Timeline)

## Benefits
1. **Personalization**: Businesses can tailor questions to their specific industry and needs
2. **Flexibility**: Questions can be updated anytime without code changes
3. **Better Qualification**: More relevant questions lead to better lead qualification
4. **Consistency**: All agents in an organization can use standardized questions

## Testing
Created comprehensive test scripts:
- `test-custom-bant-questions.js`: Full feature test including API, database, and frontend
- `run-bant-questions-migration-simple.js`: Database setup and default data insertion

## Files Modified/Created

### Created Files
1. `/BACKEND/migrations/add-custom-bant-questions.sql`
2. `/FRONTEND/financial-dashboard-2/components/agents/custom-bant-questions.tsx`
3. `/Users/macbookpro/Business/REAL-ESTATE-WEB-APP/test-custom-bant-questions.js`
4. `/Users/macbookpro/Business/REAL-ESTATE-WEB-APP/run-bant-questions-migration-simple.js`

### Modified Files
1. `/BACKEND/server.js` - Added API endpoints and modified conversation engine
2. `/FRONTEND/financial-dashboard-2/components/onboarding/agent-creation-wizard.tsx` - Added questions step
3. `/FRONTEND/financial-dashboard-2/components/agents/agent-management-page.tsx` - Added edit functionality

## Next Steps
1. Run the database migration in Supabase dashboard
2. Test the feature end-to-end
3. Consider adding:
   - Question templates for different industries
   - AI-powered question suggestions
   - Analytics on which questions are most effective
   - Multi-language support for questions

## Notes
- The feature maintains backward compatibility - existing agents will use default questions
- Questions are stored per agent, allowing different agents to have different questions
- The conversation engine gracefully falls back to hardcoded questions if database is unavailable
