# ✅ Fixed: conversationId Reference Error

## The Good News
**BANT extraction is working perfectly!** Your test successfully extracted:
- Budget: "15 Mil" ✅
- Authority: "yes" ✅  
- Need: "rental" ✅
- Timeline: "next month" ✅

## The Bug That Was Fixed
**Error**: `ReferenceError: conversationId is not defined at line 7002`

**Cause**: Wrong variable name used. The correct variable in that scope is `conv.id`, not `conversationId`.

## Fixed Code (Lines 7002 & 7007)

**Before (incorrect)**:
```javascript
contactInfo = await extractContactInfoAI(messagesForExtraction, agent, conversationId, userId);
// ...
const normalizedBant = await normalizeBANTAI(currentBant, agent, conversationId, userId);
```

**After (fixed)**:
```javascript
contactInfo = await extractContactInfoAI(messagesForExtraction, agent, conv.id, userId);
// ...
const normalizedBant = await normalizeBANTAI(currentBant, agent, conv.id, userId);
```

## Server Restart Required

**Restart the server to apply this fix:**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C) then:
node server.js
```

## Expected Behavior After Restart

1. BANT extraction will work correctly for all formats:
   - "35M" ✅
   - "30M" ✅
   - "20 Million" ✅
   - "15Mil" ✅
   
2. When BANT is complete (all 4 fields collected):
   - Contact info will be extracted
   - Lead will be created/updated
   - No more `conversationId is not defined` error

## Summary of All Fixes Applied Today

1. **Token limit**: Increased from 150 to 500
2. **Reasoning effort**: Set to 'medium' (was 'high')
3. **Verbosity**: Set to 'low' for JSON responses
4. **Prompt**: Enhanced with more budget format examples
5. **Variable name**: Fixed `conversationId` → `conv.id`

The BANT extraction system is now fully functional!
