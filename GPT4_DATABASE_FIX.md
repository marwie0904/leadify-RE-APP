# ✅ Fixed: GPT-4 References in Database

## Problem Found
The database was showing "gpt-4" and "gpt-4-turbo-preview" for recent AI operations, even though we supposedly replaced all GPT-4 models with GPT-5.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Hardcoded Model in scoreLead Function
**Location**: Line 2033 in server.js
```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong):
model: 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',  // Hardcoded GPT-4 model
operationType: 'bant_extraction',  // Also wrong operation type

// AFTER (Fixed):
model: AI_MODELS.REASONING,  // Uses GPT-5 from constants
operationType: 'bant_scoring',  // Correct operation type
```

### Issue 2: Hardcoded Model in masterIntentClassifier
**Location**: Line 4534 in server.js
```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong):
model: 'gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07',  // Hardcoded model string

// AFTER (Fixed):
model: AI_MODELS.CLASSIFIER,  // Uses constant that maps to GPT-5 Nano
```

## Why This Happened

When tracking token usage, some functions were:
1. Using the correct AI_MODELS constant for the actual API call
2. But hardcoding the model name when tracking the usage
3. This caused a mismatch where GPT-5 was actually being used, but GPT-4 was being recorded in the database

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- Database showed "gpt-4-turbo-preview" for BANT operations
- Cost calculations were using wrong model pricing
- Admin dashboard showed incorrect model usage

### After Fix:
- Database will correctly show the actual model used (GPT-5 or variants)
- Cost calculations will use correct pricing
- Admin dashboard will show accurate model distribution

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:
1. New AI operations should show correct models in the database
2. No more "gpt-4" entries should appear
3. Models should match our AI_MODELS constants:
   - `gpt-5-2025-08-07` for reasoning tasks
   - `gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07` for conversations
   - `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` for classification/extraction

## All Models Currently in Use

Based on AI_MODELS constants:
- **REASONING**: `gpt-5-2025-08-07` (high-intensive tasks)
- **CHAT_MAIN**: `gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07` (conversations)
- **CLASSIFIER**: `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` (classification)
- **EXTRACTION**: `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` (extraction)
- **EMBEDDING**: `text-embedding-3-small` (embeddings)

## Important Note

The existing "gpt-4" entries in the database are historical and won't change. Only new operations going forward will show the correct GPT-5 models. If needed, you could update the historical entries with:

```sql
-- Update historical GPT-4 entries to reflect what was actually used
UPDATE ai_token_usage
SET model = 'gpt-5-2025-08-07'
WHERE model = 'gpt-4-turbo-preview'
AND created_at > '2024-01-01';  -- Adjust date as needed
```

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: No more hardcoded model names in token tracking
✅ **Result**: Database will correctly reflect actual GPT-5 usage
✅ **Benefit**: Accurate cost tracking and model usage analytics
