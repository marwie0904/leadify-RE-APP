# Simplified BANT Questions Update

## Overview
Updated the Custom BANT Questions feature to simplify the user interface by removing placeholder text and help text fields, keeping only the question text field as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Components

#### CustomBANTQuestions Component (`custom-bant-questions.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed `placeholder_text` and `help_text` from the `BANTQuestion` interface
- ✅ Updated `DEFAULT_QUESTIONS` array to include only question text
- ✅ Removed input fields for placeholder and help text from the UI
- ✅ Simplified the `addQuestion` function to not include these fields

### 2. Backend API (`server.js`)
- ✅ Updated POST endpoint `/api/agents/:id/bant-questions` to not include placeholder/help fields
- ✅ Simplified the question insertion logic to handle only required fields

### 3. Database Migration Scripts
- ✅ Updated `run-bant-questions-migration-simple.js` to use simplified questions
- ✅ Updated `run-bant-questions-migration.js` to use simplified questions
- ✅ Created new migration `create-simplified-bant-questions.sql` with nullable fields

### 4. Test Scripts
- ✅ Updated `test-custom-bant-questions.js` to remove placeholder/help references
- ✅ Created new test `test-simplified-bant-questions.js` to verify the simplification

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Created this update summary document
- ✅ All implementation guides now reflect the simplified structure

## Database Setup

✅ **COMPLETED**: The database table has been successfully created using the Supabase MCP with:
- Table `agent_bant_questions` with nullable `placeholder_text` and `help_text` fields
- Proper indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with appropriate policies
- Table and column comments for documentation

The migration included:
1. Creating the `agent_bant_questions` table with simplified structure
2. Setting up indexes on `agent_id` and `category`
3. Enabling RLS with user-based access policies
4. Adding documentation comments

## How to Use

### In Onboarding Flow
1. Users create organization and name their agent
2. **Custom BANT Questions step** - Users see a simplified form with only question text fields
3. They can add/edit/reorder questions for each BANT category
4. Questions are saved and used during conversations

### In Agent Settings
1. Navigate to Agents page
2. Select an agent
3. Find "Custom BANT Questions" section
4. Edit questions using the same simplified interface
5. Save changes

### What Users See
- Clean, simple interface with just the question text
- No placeholder text fields
- No help text fields
- Easier to understand and faster to fill out

## Benefits of Simplification
1. **Reduced Complexity**: Users only need to think about the actual questions
2. **Faster Setup**: Less fields to fill means quicker agent configuration
3. **Cleaner UI**: More space for the important content (the questions themselves)
4. **Better UX**: Removes confusion about what placeholder and help text are for

## Testing
To verify the changes work correctly:

```bash
# Test the simplified implementation
node test-simplified-bant-questions.js

# Run the migration setup (after creating table in Supabase)
node run-bant-questions-migration-simple.js
```

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `/FRONTEND/financial-dashboard-2/components/agents/custom-bant-questions.tsx`

### Backend
- `/BACKEND/server.js` (lines 3209-3215)

### Scripts
- `/run-bant-questions-migration-simple.js`
- `/run-bant-questions-migration.js`
- `/test-custom-bant-questions.js`

### New Files
- `/BACKEND/migrations/create-simplified-bant-questions.sql`
- `/BACKEND/migrations/simplify-bant-questions.sql`
- `/test-simplified-bant-questions.js`
- `/SIMPLIFIED_BANT_QUESTIONS_UPDATE.md` (this file)

## Next Steps

1. **Run the database migration** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Test in browser** to confirm the simplified forms work
3. **Deploy** the updated backend and frontend code

## Notes
- The database fields `placeholder_text` and `help_text` remain in the schema but are nullable
- This maintains backward compatibility while allowing the simplified form
- Existing data with placeholder/help text will still work but won't be displayed
- New questions will only have the question text saved
